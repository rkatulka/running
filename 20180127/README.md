Run Type: Long run  
Distance: 18.1 Miles  
Pace: 8:41  
Time: 2:37:00
Description of run:  
This was a long run with 2 30 minute intervals.  The two intervals were at goal marathon pace.  With my three pace range, that is 7:50 to 8:10.  The rest between the two intervals was 5 minutes at an easy pace.

How did you feel?  
I felt pretty good in this run.  The first interval was pretty easy and felt like I could have kept going.  I took the rest then did the second interval.  The second one was definitely much harder.  I think I could have done a little more at that pace but overall it was pretty hard.  My paces averaged out around 7:55 to 8:00 on the intervals.

Any soreness or injuries?  
Nothing to note here.  Legs are tired after but I feel they should be.

Were you happy with the run?  
Yeah this was pretty good and I was close to hitting a half marathon PR in the middle.  I think this is good to use as a building block to a sub 3:30 marathon.
