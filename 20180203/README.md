### Training Run: Sat Feb  3 11:27:01 EST 2018
**Run Type:** Long Run  
**Distance:** 14.36  
**Pace:** 8:26  
**Time:**  2:01:01
**Description of run:**  
Just a normal long run on a recovery week.  It went pretty well and my pace is a new pace for long runs for me.  The faster end of my long run pace is 7:50 to 9:20 and the slower end is 8:15 to 9:45.  It was definitely more difficult than other 14 milers this training because of this.  It did feel good though and it wasn't so difficult that I couldn't go more.

**How did you feel?**  
I felt pretty good.  Definitely a little more difficult than usual, but I felt pretty good after mile 2ish.  The beginning did not feel good, but just had to get warmed up.

**Any soreness or injuries?**  
All good here.

**Were you happy with the run?**  
Yes!  This is a big step up being able to run this type of pace for this distance.  I think it shows how much the training program is working for me.
