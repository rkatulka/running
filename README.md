# running

This is my training log for running.  If you like the format of this log and want to use it, then follow the instructions below.

1. Sign up for github.
2. Install git bash on your machine (Windows) or install git to terminal (mac).  The site should help you with this after you sign up.
3. Fork the repository to your own repository
4. Run the below commands in your git bash or terminal.
```
git clone <url of your repository>
rm -rf 20*
```
5. Now you have a repo with 3 files: commit.sh, newDay.sh, README.md
6. README.md is the file displayed on this page for people to view
7. sh newDay.sh     - That is the command to run the new day script.  It will create a new day as a folder and fill it in with a README.md to make your notes
8. sh commit.sh     - This will push the changed files to this website to store them.  If you lose your computer or it breaks, then all the files will remain here.
